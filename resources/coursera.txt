Job Overview:

As a Staff Product Manager, you will play a pivotal role in shaping Coursera’s product vision, delivering exceptional learner and partner experiences, and driving measurable business impact. You will operate at the intersection of strategic thinking and hands-on execution, navigating ambiguity while influencing cross-functional teams.

Customer-Centric Curiosity: Exhibit deep curiosity to understand customers and all elements influencing their experience, offering comprehensive, integrated solutions that address real needs.
Thriving in Ambiguity: Operate effectively in uncertain, fast-changing environments, as often found in startup-like situations.
Balanced Skills vs. Domain Experience: While domain expertise is beneficial, strong intellectual capacity, curiosity, proactiveness, and solid foundational product skills enable quick adaptation even without prior domain exposure.
Strategic & Tactical Agility: Seamlessly switch between defining long-term vision and deep-diving into execution details when required.
IC Excellence: As an individual contributor, comfortably navigate between strategy and execution to deliver impact.
Integrated Experience Design: A track record of designing end-to-end integrated experiences is a strong plus.
Tool Familiarity: Familiarity with tools in the PM space, such as Jira, Figma or generative AI tools, though tool-specific experience is less crucial. A capable PM with strong core skills will learn quickly.
Speed of Innovation: Demonstrates the ability to rapidly prototype, test, and iterate solutions to keep pace with evolving customer needs and emerging technologies. Balances speed with rigor to deliver impactful outcomes quickly.
Responsibilities:

As a Staff Product Manager, you will define and drive product strategy and own the roadmap for a high priority area of the Coursera platform, such as AI-powered assessment or agentic enterprise integration. 
Translate customer insights and market trends into integrated solutions that can scale to serve millions of learners and customers around the world.
Lead execution from ideation and analysis  through development and launch, delivering measurable outcomes.
Partner with Engineering, Design, and Data teams to deliver AI-powered product features and experiences.
Leverage data and customer feedback to inform decisions and continuously improve.
Mentor peers and contribute to building a high-performing product organization.
Qualifications: 

You have experience building, using, or experimenting with AI-driven products, particularly in the areas of workflow automation, conversational AI, decision support, or agentic AI, and transitioning from traditional UI to AI-driven or AI-first product.
You have a high bar across the board - from your own contributions to the people you work with, to the products you work on.
Nice to haves: 

You are the product leader who inspires colleagues to think bigger, look beyond safe bets and tackle challenges with conviction. You are a builder, not an optimizer.
You are energized about solving hard problems and navigating ambiguity and rapid technology change.
You have taken products from idea to launch (0-1), with proven results post-launch.  Experience working in a start-up or internal innovation environment with high ambiguity, velocity and ownership.
You are deeply curious about customers and the positive impact your product could have on their lives.  You dive deep into data and feedback  to ground your understanding of their needs and experience using your products.
You feel a sense of responsibility and urgency to invent the future of AI as a force for unlocking human potential and expanding opportunity.
